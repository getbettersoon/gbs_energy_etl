historical_emissions_PIK,PIK-PRIMAP historical emissions,The PRIMAP-hist national historical emissions time series (1850-2018),Postdam Institute For Climate Impact Research,https://zenodo.org/record/4479172#.YGDuBq9KiUk,Historical country-level and sectoral GHG emission data (1850-2018),"The PRIMAP-hist dataset combines several published datasets to create a comprehensive set of greenhouse gas emission pathways for every country and Kyoto gas covering the years 1850 to 2018, and all UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) member states, as well as most non-UNFCCC territories. The scenario in which country reported data (CRF, BUR, UNFCCC) is prioritized over third party data (CDIAC, FAO, Andrew, EDGAR, BP) is used on Climate Watch. The data resolves the main IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) 2006 categories. Subsector data for Energy, Industrial Processes, Agriculture and Waste is available for CO2, CH4, and N2O. Due to data availability and methodological issues, version 2.2 of the PRIMAP-hist dataset does not include emissions from land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). Non-CO2 emissions are expressed in CO2 equivalents using 100-year global warming potential values from IPCC Fourth Assessment Report.","Multiple scenarios are published by PIK.
